# 3. Linear Regression
## snergy effect(tv ad and radio ad) :: interaction effect

# 3.1 simple linear regresssion
# Consequently it is a simple matter to compute
# the probability of observing any value equal to 
# |t| or larger, asumming bata_1=0. 
# We call this probability the p_value. Roughly 
# speaking, we interpret the p_value as follows:
# a small p-value indicates that it is unlikely
# to observe such a substantial association 
# between the predictor and the response due to
# chance, in the absence of any real association between
# the predictor and the response.

# 3.1.3 Assessing the accuracy of the model
# residual standard error(RSE)
# the R square statistic

# 3.2 multiple linearregression

# 3.2.2. Some Important Question
# Is There a Relationship between the response and predictors?
# The large F-statistic suggest that at least one of 
# the advertising media must be related to sales
